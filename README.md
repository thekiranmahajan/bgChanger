# I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project:  bgChanger! 🚀

With the power of React and the useState Hook, I've created a dynamic background color changer that lets you customize your webpage's background color with the click of a button.

It's not just about functionality; it's also about aesthetics and interactivity. UI is awesome🤩

## Here's how it works:

- I've set a default background color using the useState Hook.
- I've added a set of customized color buttons, each with a cool animation on hover and an active state.
- When you click on one of these buttons, the background color magically transforms to your chosen hue!

And you know what? None of this would have been possible without the fantastic guidance of Hitesh Choudhary and his "Chai aur React" series on YouTube. 🙏

Hitesh's tutorials are nothing short of magic. They not only teach you the technical aspects but also inspire creativity and innovation. 

I'm immensely grateful for his guidance on this journey.
